# Theorem_Resolver_in_CommonLisp

As a part of an assignment in the Introduction to AI course, I was required to implement a theorem prover in Common Lisp for an axiomatic system. I developed a theorem prover that takes in the clausal form of first-order logic expressions, representing the axioms of the axiomatic system, and proves by contradiction. The developed theorem prover used the breadth-first technique in choosing the clauses for resolving and generating new resolvents.
